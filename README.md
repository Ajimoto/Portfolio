![Screenshot](<./assets/Screen%20Shot%202022-08-29%20at%201.04.21%20PM%20(2).png>)

# goal

create a webpage that will be updated with new work projects and links to my contact information

# useage

Over time as I gain more skills and experience with coding I can display my projects that create on the webpage. I can also use the webpage as part of a resume once it is good enough.

each link in the nav-bar will be useable to navigate the page once finished. each project will have an interactive hover and click function that will direct the viewer to the project that was built.
